AI security platform! 🛡️
AI Safety Threat Detection
comprehensive AI safety and misinformation detection platform! 🛡️
CogniGuard is a text perturbation detection system designed to fight misinformation on the internet.

Detecting prompt injection, jailbreaks, data exfiltration

The Science Behind It
CogniGuard is based on research for ACL 2025 (a top academic conference for AI and language).

What is a "Perturbation"?
A perturbation is a small change to text that:

Makes it look different to computers
But humans can still read it
Helps evade content moderation systems


 How CogniGuard Works
The Technology Stack:
Component	Purpose
PyTorch	Deep learning framework
Transformers	AI language models (like BERT)
Sentence-Transformers	Understanding text meaning
NLTK	Natural language processing
Scikit-learn	Machine learning algorithms
FastAPI	Serving the API
The Process:
text

User sends text → CogniGuard analyzes it → Returns detection results
Step by step:

📥 Input: User sends suspicious text
🔍 Analysis: AI models examine the text
🧮 Detection: Identifies which perturbation types are present
📊 Scoring: Calculates confidence scores
📤 Output: Returns detailed results
🌐 The Three Ways to Use CogniGuard
You've built THREE access methods:

1️⃣ Python Package (For Developers)
Python

pip install cogniguard

from cogniguard import analyze

result = analyze("Th3 vaxx is s4fe fr fr no cap")
print(result)
Who uses this: Python programmers who want to add detection to their apps.

2️⃣ Command Line Tool (For Quick Checks)
Bash

cogniguard analyze "Th3 vaxx is s4fe fr fr no cap"
Who uses this: Researchers and developers for quick testing.

3️⃣ REST API (For Everyone!)
