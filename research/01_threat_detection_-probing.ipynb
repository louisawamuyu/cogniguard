    "## Research Question: Do LLMs Have Internal \"Threat Detection\" Representations?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates whether language models internally represent\n",
    "the concept of \"this input is a threat/attack\" when processing adversarial\n",
    "prompts like jailbreak attempts or prompt injections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "1. Can we find a linear direction that separates threat from safe inputs?\n",
    "2. At which layer does this representation emerge?\n",
    "3. How robust is this representation across different threat types?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance to AI Safety:\n",
    "If models have internal threat representations, we could potentially:\n",
    "- Monitor models for awareness of adversarial inputs\n",
    "- Steer models to be more resistant to attacks\n",
    "- Understand why some jailbreaks work and others don't\n",

    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Threat Detection Direction Exists\n",
    "We found a linear direction in layer {best_layer} that can distinguish\n",
    "between safe and threatening inputs with {accuracy}% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Representation Emerges Gradually\n",
    "The divergence between safe and threat representations {pattern}\n",
    "through the layers, suggesting that threat detection is a \n",
    "{early/late/gradual} phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implications for AI Safety\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: We could use this direction to detect when a model\n",
    "  is processing an adversarial input.\n",
    "- **Steering**: Potentially steer away from this direction to make\n",
    "  models more robust to attacks.\n",
    "- **Understanding**: The layer at which this emerges tells us something\n",
    "  about how the model processes adversarial inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Test on larger models (GPT-2 medium/large)\n",
    "2. Analyze different threat types separately\n",
    "3. Investigate attention patterns at critical layers\n",
    "4. Test if steering along this direction affects model behavior\n",
